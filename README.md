# 1. Goal
The goal of this portfolio is to showcase who I am and what I can do, for potential recruitors to see if we would be a good fit.

# 2. Brainstorming

It's worth thinking about how to accomplish this goal. 

For decades, we have had resumes and cover letters to fulfill this goal. 

But what is it that websites and interactivity can bring to the table?

## 2.1. Possible features made possible by the web

1. Having search possibilities
2. Having video to present myself = a way to meet me without having already met me - And give at once a good feel of who I am
3. Having interactivity: buttons, sliders, dropdowns to contain information
4. Forms to communicate, polls
5. Newsletters
6. Social media direct links

# 3. UX Design
